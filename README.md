# Rust Learning Journey (rustlrn)

Welcome! This repository documents my journey of learning the Rust programming language. The goal is to create a clear, step-by-step resource that others can also use to learn Rust.

## Folder Structure

- `topics/`: Deep dives into specific Rust concepts (Ownership, Borrowing, etc.).
- `examples/`: Runnable code examples related to each topic.
- `cargo_setup.md`: A guide on how to get started with Cargo.

## Current Topics

- [Ownership & Memory Management](topics/ownership/README.md)

## Contributors

Special thanks to those who have contributed their time and knowledge to this documentation:

- **Obot (@oboobotenefiok)**: Provided detailed explanations on Ownership rules and memory management.
