# Rust Learning Journey (rustlrn)

Welcome! This repository documents my journey of learning the Rust programming language. The goal is to create a clear, step-by-step resource that others can also use to learn Rust.



## Folder Structure

- `TOPICS/(Topic)/README.md`: Deep dives into specific Rust concepts (Ownership, Borrowing, etc.).
- `TOPICS/(Topic)/snippets/`: Runnable code examples related to each topic.
- `TOPICS/SETTING-UP/cargo_setup.md`: A guide on how to get started with Cargo.

I ADVISE YOU READ THE TOPICS IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY ARE NUMBERED.
## Current Topics

- [Ownership & Memory Management](topics/ownership/README.md)
