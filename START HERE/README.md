# Rust Learning Journey (rustlrn)

Welcome! This repository documents my journey of learning the Rust programming language. The goal is to create a clear, step-by-step resource that others can also use to learn Rust.

## Folder Structure

- `topics/(topic)/README...`: Deep dives into specific Rust concepts (Ownership, Borrowing, etc.).
- `topics/(topic)/snippets/`: Runnable code examples related to each topic.
- `SET-UP/cargo_setup.md`: A guide on how to get started with Cargo.
